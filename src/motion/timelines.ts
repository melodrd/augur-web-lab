/** Use cases on the review copies (owner, 25 Oct 2026): each case is a product card that waits, gets its answer
 * and acts (use-cases-v2.js, which gets this and `easing` written in). A pick draws the 2 px Green line from the
 * tab over `link`, fades the shown case out over `out` and the picked one in from `at` over `in`.
 * Each card loops (owner, 28 Oct 2026: "all animations should be going in a loop"), keyed by `loop` on one
 * `cycle` that opens and closes on the finished card, from when `threshold` of the stage is in view. The reset
 * is soft, never a cut (owner, 28 Oct 2026): every part but the status chip dims to `dim` over `fade`; from
 * `reset` each finished value fades out over `resetOut`, and the first state fades in over `resetIn`, where
 * Asked grows in from `statusFrom` scale and a Paper ring lights it over `glow`, `swapIn` later. A
 * pick, or a press on the case shown, starts the case where its finished values are gone (`reset` +
 * `resetOut`); a press dips its card out over `out` and back in over `in` first.
 * Then one part is lit at a time (owner, 28 Oct 2026: "our eyes are not going to where it should be going"),
 * each change of light over `light`, centred on its moment: at `focus` the app's part lights and the chip
 * steps back to `past`, and the app's part plays; at `reported` the light moves to Augur Lituus, the app's part
 * steps back to `past`, and a 2 px line fades in over `waitIn`, `waitIn` after the report, and fills until
 * `final`; at `final` the Yes turns Green and its seal grows in, with its check, from `swapIn` over `seal`; at
 * `paid` the app's part lights again and acts; from `rest` everything is back up, and the finished card holds
 * to the end of the cycle (3.3 s). A rising price slides `slide` percent up as it rises; a word swaps in place,
 * the old one gone over `out` before the new one is in by `in`. Transform and opacity only, so the loop runs
 * off the main thread (the check's stroke no longer draws: drawn on every cycle, it restyled every frame).
 * The market card (owner, 26 Oct 2026, "Split it is") plays the whitepaper's order (§4.5): the price's digits
 * climb a step at each of `ticks` (to 99¢: consensus, not settlement), and it pays at `paid`. The insurance card,
 * a relay (owner, 28 Oct 2026, "Relay it is"), adds `relay`: the flight's leg lights and its stop comes in at
 * `depart`, and its stretch of line runs Paper from `focus` to the last of `ticks`, when it lands; at `reported`
 * Augur Lituus's stop comes in with a Paper Yes, and the next stretch fills Pewter until `final`, when the stop
 * becomes the seal; from `paid` the line runs Green to the cover over `pay` (travel easing), and `arrive` after
 * `paid` the cover's stop fills and "Paid" comes in. The DAO card, a switch (owner, 29 Oct 2026, "implement the
 * Switch into /melo"), adds `switch`: at `close` the vote has Passed and the go-live switch slides on over
 * `slide` (travel easing), its knob and ring turning Paper (`close` comes before the market's last tick, so Passed
 * is read before the light moves on). Augur Lituus, the larger part, shows both answers: at `reported` Yes's
 * ring lights, the line for the day it's open to challenge fills until `final`, then the Green sweeps across
 * Yes over `in`, its checked label shows `pick` later, and No steps back to `other`. At `paid` the switch slides
 * back off over `slide`, its knob turning Green halfway, and the status turns to Blocked. The query's status chip
 * comes in from `statusFrom` scale. */
