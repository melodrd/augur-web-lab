/** Homepage v2 copy, the /2/ review copy (owner, 21 Oct 2026). One home for every v2 string: the
 * home sections read it through homeCopy() (homepage-review.ts) when `variant` is 'v2'; v1 keeps its
 * copy where it is, untouched. v3 and v4 (homepage-v3.ts, homepage-v4.ts) spread this object and
 * override it section by section, so a change here reaches them too wherever they don't override.
 * Source: Ryan's 17 notes as Augus marked them (dash = do, X = don't, 1–3 = Augus rewrote it).
 * Each entry names its source: "Ryan n" or "Augus n".
 * Augus's worry is that v2 turns technical, so jargon stays in the small supporting lines.
 * Not changed in v2: the hero headline and art (Ryan 1), "?" tooltips (Ryan 6, X), the roadmap
 * (Ryan 14) and an intent split of the page (Ryan 16, X).
 * Guardrails: no ranking claim without a source (the whitepaper's own modelled estimate backs one,
 * hedged, in the hero's "more than ever before" and the Robust card; Augus to confirm); a fork has a
 * two-week one-way migration window (whitepaper §4.2, docs/sources.md); unmigrated REP loses its
 * value, the fork never takes it; REP is optional, never a duty to report or challenge.
 * Draft copy for review, not approved. Deliberately not flagged `needsReview`: /2/ is a review route
 * and the flag would add launch blockers (check-launch).
 * The variant type and the version list live in homepage-review.ts. */

    // Ryan 13 + Augus 2: what REP is for, and that holding it isn't passive. Each point keeps a
    // condition (house rules: no guarantees; REP is optional, never a duty to report or challenge):
    // - Staking is how you report or challenge (the bond, §4.1 p5; the only staking in the paper), and
    //   rewards go only to an answer that holds (§4.3.1 p6; rep.ts). "Put it to work" is Ryan's; "if you
    //   want" carries v1's "Optional.".
    // - The fork window is the whitepaper's proposed design (§2.2 p2 "a two week, one-way migration
    //   window"; Lituus-CS forking isn't built, docs/sources.md), hence "is designed to". Unmoved REP
    //   loses its value (§4.2.2 p5): Augus's "risk losing the token" is reworded, since nothing takes it.
    //   Ryan's "check in at least once a month" is declined: the paper sets no cadence, and a monthly
    //   check could miss a two-week window.
    // Labels, not squares (owner, 29 Oct 2026, sketch A of the Holding REP board: "Earn", then Ryan's
    // "Non-passivity" in plain words): each point is a tile led by its `label`, and `earn` gives Earn's the
    // Green outline. Earn is incisive (REP earns REP, like work that pays, "paid in REP", never money, price or
    // yield) and stays conditional and optional; the fork point is calm: a last resort (rep.ts), then what to
    // do, then the one fact, plainly (moving doesn't promise value, so it says only what unmoved REP loses).
    // Smaller (owner, same day: "occupying too much space"), then one full-width Navy card with the points as spec
    // rows (round 5 of the Holding REP board: "just text floating around looks weird"): each `label` is the row's
    // term. Earn echoes the heading ("Know what happened?"); "when you know" keeps taking part a choice. The fork
    // row is about not being fully passive, never a duty or a threat (owner: "do not scare people away"): holding
    // is mostly hands-off, and a fork opens a window to move (the two-week window is a proposed design, so it
    // stays unnamed; what unmoved REP loses is on the REP page). `link` names the REP page by what it gives you
    // ("Learn more" says nothing), an outline button in the card.
