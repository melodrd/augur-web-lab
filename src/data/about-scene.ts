/** The About hero's scene (owner, 30 Oct 2026: "layers it is. polish a little bit then add it there", picked from
 * five isometric options on the About hero scenes board). Augur Lituus comes next, on top of Augur's earlier
 * versions: a dark base, a Mist layer and the Green block, a stepped stack in the Why Augur cards' kit (iso-kit.ts),
 * drawn at the kit's largest scale so its lines weigh what theirs do. Once a loop the Green block lifts off and is
 * set down again; while it is up, its footprint shows on the layer below. The resting frame, which no JavaScript,
 * reduced motion and print show, is the finished stack. There are no words. AboutScene.astro draws it and plays
 * the track on the site's 12 s cycle. */
